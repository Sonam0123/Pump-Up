<h1>Proposal</h1>
<hr>

<p>This website is built for people with fitness goals such as losing fat, getting leaner, staying toned, and bulking. It focuses more on the weight-lifting aspect of fitness. </p>
<br>
<h1>Wireframes</h1>
<hr>
<ul>
    <li>The App component is going to pass down data to the Login and Goal component.
</li>
    <li>After the user selects their goal, their weight is asked and a workout plan is given to them depending on their goal.</li>
    <li>There is also going to be a weight chart that shows the user's weight history to keep track of their progress.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h1>Backend Components</h1>
<hr>
<p>For the backend, I will be using Express and MongoDB to make an API that will store the user's weight and also update it. The frontend will call the API to retrieve the data and render it on the page.
</p>
<h4>Weight</h4>
<p>The weight model will hold user's weight data and will contain the user's name.</p>
<br>
<h1>User Stories</h1>
<hr>
<ul>
    <li>As a user, I want to be able to log in to my account.</li>
    <li>As a user, I want to be able to select my goal.</li>
    <li>As a user, I want to be able to enter my weight.</li>
    <li>As a user, I want to be able to see my workout plan.</li>
    <li>As a user, I want to be able to see my weight history.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h1>MVP goal</h1>
<hr>
<p>As an MVP goal, I would just want the functionality to work and the website to look pleasing for the users. This means that the users can login, have their own individual id's to keep track of their weight and provide them with workout plans.</p>
<br>
<h1>Stretch Goals</h1>
<hr>
<p>Once the MVP goal has been reached, I'd like to add authentication, a profile page where users can see their statistics, and a functionality for users to create their own workout plan.</p>
